This work represents a novel atempt at creating a 3D game engine developed in C++ (mostly C style C++). The engine does not use external third-party libraries and seeks to have as little overhead as possible, i. e. polymorphism, classes and inheritance, smart pointers etc. Heavily inspired by the coding phylosophy of famous game devs like Jonathan Blow, Casey Muratori, Travis Vroman etc.

The engine is named Koala Engine as a tribute to the lovable and resilient nature of koalas. Just like how a koala thrives in diverse environments with adaptability and charm, Koala Engine is designed to be flexible and robust, capable of supporting developers in creating a wide variety of 3D games. The name reflects the engine's focus on being user-friendly yet powerfulâ€”much like the calm and dependable koala, the engine is built to be a reliable companion in your game development journey. Plus, who wouldn't love the idea of a koala helping you build your dream game?

## Roadmap

As a starting point, I am following the architectural choices that Travis Vroman does in his Kohi game engine series on Youtube, which are also very similar to the design showcased in the Game Engine Architecture Third Edition book. I expect the architecture to deviate from the one I am currently following once the engine is mature enough, and once I have more experience with the architecture side.

See [here](TODO.md).

### Prerequisites for Windows
The engine supports two different compilers with two different built systems for Windows: ninja (using the Microsoft compiler MSVC) and Visual Studio (using LLVM clang frontend). 

The ninja build requires that Visual Studio is installed and that cl.exe (the Microsoft compiler MSVC) and its related environments variables are already setup. To do so, Visual Studio provides a premade .bat file located at "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat". Either run the build script from Developed Command Prompt for Visual Studio or run this batch file on the startup of a powershell terminal. This can be done in the $profile file of the powershell.

Instead for the Visual Studio build you must install clang from the official LLVM releases, and setup the clang frontend in your PATH during the installation. 

- CMake for Windows: `scoop install cmake` or `winget install -e --id Kitware.CMake` 
- Visual Studio (preferrably the latest version): https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/. Remember to select Desktop C++ Development during installation
- Git for Windows: `scoop install git` or `winget install git.git` OR https://gitforwindows.org/
- Vulkan SDK: `winget install khronosgroup.vulkansdk` OR download from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/
- Ninja (only if you want to build with ninja): https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases. Remember to add the path to the ninja.exe to your PATH

 Ninja would be the method I recommend as it is the most similar to the linux build and it also creates the compile_commands.json file that allows you to edit your code with you code editor of choice, while the clang build offers intellisense only inside Visual Studio IDE. However it requires some extra steps, that is why both build systems are supported.

### Prerequisites for Linux

As you can imagine, the linux setup is much faster from the standpoint of the libraries. You just need to install these via package manager:

- `sudo apt install llvm` or `sudo pacman -S llvm`
- `sudo apt install git` or `sudo pacman -S git`
- `sudo apt install cmake`

Required for X11:

- `sudo apt install libx11-dev`
- `sudo apt install libxkbcommon-x11-dev`
- `sudo apt install libx11-xcb-dev`

The only part that is slightly more convoluted compared to the Windows build, is setting up Vulkan. In linux you have to download the compressed Vulkan library from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home in the Linux section and download the .tar.xz file. After extracting the library in your location of choice, you must add the LIBRARY_PATH/x86_64 as your VULKAN_SDK environment variable, and add VULKAN_SDK/bin in your path. They also provide a shell script setup_env.sh that is supposed to do this automatically, but in my Arch distro I did not have any luck with that so I setup the variables manually in my shell of choice (FISH).

## Contributions

TODO: I will specify some protocol for contributing with PR for the engine in a later moment, once the engine receives a bit more clout :)
