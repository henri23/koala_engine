# Koala Game Engine

<img src="images/koala_engine_logo.png?raw=true" alt="Kohi Logo" height=100/>

This work represents a novel atempt at creating a 3D game engine developed in C++ (mostly C style C++). The engine does not use external third-party libraries and seeks to have as little overhead as possible, i. e. polymorphism, classes and inheritance, smart pointers etc. 

The engine is named Koala Engine as a tribute to the lovable and resilient nature of koalas. Just like how a koala thrives in diverse environments with adaptability and charm, Koala Engine is designed to be flexible and robust, capable of supporting developers in creating a wide variety of 3D games. The name reflects the engine's focus on being user-friendly yet powerfulâ€”much like the calm and dependable koala, the engine is built to be a reliable companion in your game development journey. Plus, who wouldn't love the idea of a koala helping you build your dream game?
